## What is this?

Why I'm glad you asked!

This is my website, evidence of my passion, and maybe even inspiration for your own project
## What's going on here

It may be unoriginal or even cliche to imitate the terminal, But I don't care dammit!
This has been a fun project with plenty of fun problems to solve along the way.

## Okay, Okay. Tell me more

### My goals for this project

- Pure Javascript, CSS, and HTML.  No frameworks!
- Learn me some ECMA Script 6
- Be detailed and convicing
- Have fun (told you this was cliche)
