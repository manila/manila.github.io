404(7)                  Miscellaneous Information Manual                  404(7)

DESCRIPTION
       The 404 (Not Found) status code indicates that the origin server did not
       find a current representation for the target resource or is not willing
       to disclose that one exists.  A 404 status code does not indicate whether
       this lack of representation is temporary or permanent; the 410 (Gone)
       status code is preferred over 404 if the origin server knows, presumably
       through some configurable means, that the condition is likely to be
       permanent.

       A 404 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated
       by the method definition or explicit cache controls
